## :star2: About the Project

Exploration of interactive data visualisation packages for the SAIDS 521 module in MADS degree

## :bookmark_tabs: Details on Data

The Graduate Employment Survey (GES) is jointly conducted by NTU, NUS, SMU, SIT (from 2014), SUTD (from 2015) and SUSS (from 2018) annually to survey the employment conditions of graduates about six months after their final examinations. The Ministry of Education (MOE) publishes the results of key employment indicators of the survey to provide prospective students with timely and comparable data to assist them in making informed course decisions.
